# Blogpost-prediction

This is a data project to predict blogposts with the most comments for social marketing. A few year back I participated in an interview for a Data Scientist position at a certain finacial company, and this project was an elaborate "interview question" for the position. Candidates were given 9 days to analysed the data, and at the end of the 9 days submit the code, and give a presentation that is targeted to executive level audiences (i.e non-technical), to answer the question - should we buy this data. 

Of course, the data is not actually commercial secret - it is freely available data from the website.... The excercise was simply to evaluate the candidate's ability to actually use real data for a real-life problem, which is often vague, and to present the results in a way that non-technical audiences can understand, which is extremely important.

While at the end I did not get the position, the feedback I got was quite good, and I believe that there are things to be learnt from this exercise. That's why I would like to share this with every budding data scientists who are interested. 

This repository contains:
- The python code used to preform all the analysis and prediction tasks
- The graphs and result files generated by the code
- The presentation that was presented at the final interview
